## My process

- Marked up html 
- Wrote out each part of the css blocks to fill in to make it neat and tidy.
- I also moved only one section at a time, each section was done before I moved onto the next. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I did not learn anything new here; it was a warm-up before other things, like other tutorials, just to practice things i have already learned and see if I could recall it all up to my mind as I was looking at the reference image, and I was able to do that. 

I also think I learned to be neater and more organized and it helped me a lot and I enjoyed that process. 

### Continued development

Everything needs continued development, and I think time to move up a step; intimidation be damned. 

### Useful resources

- [`CSS`) The Definitive Guide book] - I used the info on box-shadow to understand the syntax and use it in this below the payment button
